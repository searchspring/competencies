# Competency - Full Stack

You are able to create a backend API service and a complementary frontend user interface.

## How do you prove it?

Your frontend communicates with API routes on the backend.

You created a backend application that exposes various endpoints utilizing standard server-side web API (REST, SOAP, GraphQL, etc...) best practices.

You created a frontend interface that sends and recieves data to the endpoints to create a funcational application. 


# Competency - Full Stack - Level 2

You are able to create functional applications that utilize a backend with data stores and an interface for the user.

Expanding on work done in Level 1 - your application is enhanced by utlizing:
* testing (unit / integration / E2E)
* session management (secure endpoints)
* database
* authentication

## How do you prove it?

Expanding on your Level 1 Application:

Your application (backend and frontend) have over 80% code coverage.

Some endpoints are secured, requiring authentication to access.

Data is stored in a database.

## How do you improve it?

Add real-time updates on the frontend (websockets).
