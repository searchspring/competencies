# Competency - Athena Level 1
Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3
using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay
only for the queries that you run. Amazon Athena supports ANSI SQL queries. Amazon Athena uses
Presto, an open source, in-memory, distributed SQL engine, and can handle complex analysis,
including large joins, window functions, and arrays.

## How do you prove it?
- You are comfortable using the query editor to perform basic SELECT queries.
- You can explain the difference between Athena and another datasource such as a Redshift or MySQL Database.
- You can explain the strengths of PrestoDB and how it relates to AWS Athena.
- You can explain schema-on-read and its strengths & weaknesses.

## How do you improve it?
- Read the [athena docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/index.html)
- Read the [presto db docs](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/)

# Competency - Athena Level 2

## How do you prove it?
