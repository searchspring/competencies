# Test Driven Development

The software developement activity where you write your tests before you write your production code.  
The point of TDD is so that you end up with a self testing codebase so that you can fearlessly refactor your code.
Refactoring is a critical part of software development as trying to refactor without tests is terrifying.
Here is Uncle Bob talking about why - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvAzrC6-spQ

## How do you prove it?

You have a code base you authored that has 80%+ code coverage.
You can describe three situtaions under which unit testing becomes unreliable.
You can demonstrate the use of a visual code coverage tool and what the different coverage types mean.
You can describe what the process of TDD's Red Green Refactor cycle involves.
You can articulate good practices for assertions in your tests.
