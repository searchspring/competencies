<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Elasticsearch is a powerful tool which is essential for all search engineers in today&rsquo;s climate. Many online retailers and search providers have turned to ES as the core of their search platform. While sometimes treated as a NoSQL database, Elasticsearch is better described as a document store and search enginge, as there are a number of mechanisms and measures present in, say, an SQL RDB that ES is lazy about in the interest of performance. At it&rsquo;s core, Elasticsearch runs Lucene to track and manage data in the form of documents; the rest of ES might be regarded in a simplified sense as a Java wrapper which co-ordinates distributed instances of that data, accessible via a well documented, RESTful API.</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Truly, there is much, much more to Elasticsearch in terms of features and applications than could be written here. For more information on Elasticsearch, I&rsquo;d start with their site - elastic.co - which is rich in learning resources.</p>

<h2 class="px-2 text-2xl mt-4">How do you prove it?</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can describe what a node is, as well as the roles it might serve in a cluster.</li>
<li>You can describe an index, both in terms of configuration (types, mappings, etc.) and composition (shards, replicas, etc.).</li>
<li>You know how to interact with a cluster via the CLI. You are able to perform status checks as well as search queries, with a comprehensive understanding of the responses from both.</li>
<li>You can create an index, load it with documents, and query them.</li>
<li>You can describe quorum based decision making, where it is used in ES, and the ubiquitous arithmetic formula associated with it.</li>
<li>You can fill in the blank: &ldquo;You know, for _____.&rdquo;</li>
<li>You can discuss why you believe ES is so commonly used in e-commerce search.</li>
<li>You can describe when it is better to use an RDB over ES.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="px-2 text-2xl mt-4">How do you improve it?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Play with the API in a sandbox and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html">read the manual</a>! (Be sure to look at the version with which you are interacting, but don&rsquo;t neglect new features, either)</li>
<li>Read any of the numerous blogs and articles which have been published surrounding the fundamentals of ES and the neat ways it is being used.</li>
<li>Struggle through building a small cluster and using it for some interesting use cases like <a href="https://logz.io/learn/complete-guide-elk-stack/">the ELK stack</a>, autocomplete/spell-correction using <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-suggesters.html">Suggesters</a>, or <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-suggesters.html">metrics analytics</a>.</li>
<li>See Elasticsearch Level 2 (TBD)</li>
