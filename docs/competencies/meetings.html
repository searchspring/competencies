<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Two or more people come together to do one of the following:
Share information, Make some strategic decision, Tackle a tough problem, Cross department alignment, Retrospectives, Team planning</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">This document talks about how do you run a successful meeting, the advanced section talks about specific types of meeting / meeting skills.</p>

<h2 class="px-2 text-2xl mt-4">How do you prove it?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Your meeting invites have an agenda shared in advance, outlining the purpose of having the meeting and the goals of the meeting.</li>
<li>When you start a meeting you clearly articulate what the meeting is for at a high level.</li>
<li>Your meeting is structured with assigned roles, from the start of the meeting:

<ul>
<li>Who is running the meeting. (Chair)</li>
<li>Who is making sure remote participants have a voice. (Remote-connector)</li>
<li>Who is taking notes. (Notetaker, idealy not the same as the Chair)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your meetings have action items and notes.</li>
<li>Your meetings have an appropriate amount of time.</li>
<li>You book a meeting room when appropriate.</li>
<li>You check people&rsquo;s calendars before you book the meeting and talk to people with conflicts before scheduling.</li>
<li>Your meetings get good feedback about their usefulness.</li>
<li>Show that you can invite optional attendees and non-optional. (If in doubt, mark the attendee as optional.)</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ve sent out a summary and notes after the meeting to the attendees.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="px-2 text-2xl mt-4">How do you improve it?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Organize meetings, practice.</p></li>

<li><p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Ask people if they found the meeting useful.</p></li>

<li><p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Organize meeting note, making sure they aren&rsquo;t too long. Rather, meeting notes capture two things: outcomes/decisions, and action items. That is: what did we decide, and what are we doing next to act on those decisions?</p></li>

<li><p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Post the poll in slack after a meeting.</p>

<pre><code>/poll &quot;How was that meeting?&quot; &quot;I always want to be in this meeting I get enormous value from it&quot; &quot;I sometimes get value from this meeting... please add ideas for improvement below&quot; &quot;I think this meeting would be better if... please add ideas for improvement below&quot; &quot;I don't think I need to be in this meeting&quot;
</code></pre></li>

<li><p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Get familiar with the keyboard shortcuts: Toggling mute (CMD+d for mac users)</p></li>

<li><p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Use extensions like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meet-mute/dkgoclojlihiolngeagmhkjiglmoeeic?hl=en">Meet Mute</a> and setup the keyboard shortcuts for toggling mute.</p></li>
</ul>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2"><strong>Running Meetings</strong></p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Meetings are one of the most effective ways in which we work together. It&rsquo;s crucial that we ensure that we use the time well.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you scheduled the meeting, you are the chair unless you&rsquo;ve delegated this role to someone else</li>
<li>It is up to the chair to ensure someone is taking notes</li>
<li>It is the chair&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that the meeting agenda items are covered and to be timekeeper</li>
<li>It is the responsibility of each attendee to review the agenda prior to the meeting and read the relevant material or topics.</li>
</ul>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2"><strong>Meeting Notes</strong>
Meeting notes aren&rsquo;t a long transcription of the meeting, or what was said. Rather, meeting notes capture two things: outcomes/decisions, and action items. That is: what did we decide, and what are we doing next to act on those decisions? See below.
Here are the expectations for meeting notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Must include:

<ul>
<li>Meeting topic and the agenda</li>
<li>Attendees</li>
<li>Date</li>
<li><strong>Action items/next steps</strong></li>
<li><strong>Decisions made</strong></li>
<li>Optional: more detailed notes. Keep in mind that meeting notes can be as simple as a photo of your notebook page with your handwritten action items! (Don&rsquo;t overthink it).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Meeting notes are shared with the attendees, but also with any stakeholder on the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-rUFy-EBIfUtu76PEB6DZavOsu3VZYxj">RACI</a> chart for the project</li>
<li>Meeting notes are easy to find for anyone interested who is looking for them (ideally, without having to ask)</li>
<li>Shared same day as the meeting unless otherwise discussed with the group</li>
<li>Ask yourself: if you were on vacation for a week and returned, would you be able to know that this meeting occurred and find the notes easily?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="px-2 text-2xl mt-4">Level 2</h2>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Have achieved all the things for the basic competency and additionally can administer run specific types of meetings.</p>

<h2 class="px-2 text-2xl mt-4">How do you prove it?</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can run a retrospective to gather feedback about process improvement.</li>
<li>You can run a post-mortem effectively to gather feedback about an event.</li>
<li>You can run brainstorming meetings with several people.</li>
</ul>
