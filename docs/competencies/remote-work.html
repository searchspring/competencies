<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">As distinct from working from home, remote work is when your primry workspace is away from the main office.
Like during a pandemic.</p>

<ul>
<li>Remote work is hard!  It requires a lot of discipline, time management, internal motivation.</li>
<li>Remote work is glorious!  It gives you unprecedented, uninterrupted time to get work done,
and you get to choose all the snacks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="px-2 text-2xl mt-4">How do you prove it?</h2>

<ul>
<li>You have a fast, reliable internet connection/power, show us your speed test.</li>
<li>You have a quiet area to work free from interruptions and noise.</li>
<li>You are available on slack/email/etc&hellip; during work hours.  Available means different things to different roles,
talk to your manager about their expectations for your availability.</li>
<li>You have a working headset and good audio.  In conference calls people don&rsquo;t tell you that you&rsquo;re breaking up or
they can&rsquo;t hear you.</li>
<li>You have a working webcam and good lighting for video.  The attention needed for attending a video conference
should be the same as meeting someone across the table.</li>
<li>You are proficient in using video conferencing apps; mute/unmute audio, turn video on/off, share screen</li>
<li>You are responsive to your colleagues.  Again, responsive means different things to different roles,
check with your manager.</li>
<li>You can explain why you should switch to a video chat, as opposed to slack, as opposed to Asana.
When to use these mediums and when not to.</li>
<li>You know how to unblock your tasks and can describe who you go to in various situations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="px-2 text-2xl mt-4">How do you improve it?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Plan your entire week to the best of your ability.  Planning allows you to remain focused,
and not be distracted by the scores of personal projects at home.</li>
<li>Block off sections of your calendar to ensure you manage your weekly workload.</li>
<li>Use calendar plugin to automatically set meeting status in Slack</li>
<li>Proactively setting status in Slack for short breaks like, out to lunch, be-right-back, etc</li>
<li>Tell your team about extended break like, walk the dog be back in an hour, dental appointment be back at 2, etc</li>
<li>When you have a chance to visit the office, make it count, make it known to everyone that you are in the office.
Pack your schedule for meeting people in person. Make a point to greet and meet, even if it is just a walk by.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="px-2 text-2xl mt-4">Examples of remote worker schedules.</h2>

<h3 class="px-2 text-xl mt-2">Example 1:</h3>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">On Sunday I review the week ahead, and check for meeting double bookings, and reschedule things that need to be.</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">I pull in the work for the week that I hope to get done and schedule some large blocks of time in my calendar that
I can do that work in.</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Each day, I get up at 5:30am PT to be on time for the 9am start in ET, and as much overlap with Poland as possible.</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">I process all my inbound - capture task from slack / email into my task management in asana, and respond and
unblock as many projects / people before the first meeting.</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">I check my calendar and make sure I have prep time for each meeting, if I don&rsquo;t I do the prep time as a first step in
the day.</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">I check my task list for the weeks work and remind myself of the critical projects I&rsquo;m responsible for.</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">In the first gap in my calendar is where I take my shower, and I also use that time to think strategically about the
rest of the day - &ldquo;what is the best thing I could work on next&rdquo;.  As opposed to the morning where I have mostly been
reactive and trying to unblock as many things as possible.</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">I finish my day at roughly 2pm PT but am available on slack till around 5pm PT for the rest of the team.</p>

<h3 class="px-2 text-xl mt-2">Example 2:</h3>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">I wake up at my regular time of 6am CT</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Instead of showering as I would when going ot the office I just go to my home office and catch up on any reminders
I set and do some reading, I often read a chapter or two in a book, a relevant business book.</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">My day flows from there as more people get online and discussions and meetings start.</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">I used a free hour around lunch to go for a 30 minute run, 10 minute cooldown and shower and eat lunch
(I typically eat leftovers and lunch is about fuel for me so it&rsquo;s minutes of time)</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">Then the afternoon is all about meetings or projects, if an important project I will have blocked time.</p>

<p style="width:50rem" class="px-2">I finish my day at roughly 4pm CT depending on meetings.</p>
